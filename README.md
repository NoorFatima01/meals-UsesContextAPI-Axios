# React Application with Context API and Axios

- **Context API**: The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, allowing you to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. It's aimed at solving the prop-drilling problem of passing data through many layers of components.
- **Axios**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, and it has a simple API and can handle requests and responses in JSON format, making it ideal for use with modern web applications.
